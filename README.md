Speed Reader

Created for 3 Day Startup Austin Spring 2014. Company Knowsys.

A more beautiful speed reader. Check out the [demo](http://sartaj.me/speed-reader).

Conceptually, this is designed to help read through an article quicker. But unlike other speed readers that tend to only show the current word, this one shows the previous and next work in an elegant transition, reducing eye strain.
